# spotify-video-player

A fun way to find and play top spotify tracks and playlist on your desktop. 

This quick project connects directly to your Spotify, lets you browse genre's, playlist's, and track's created by Spotify. When you play a song, a video will appear to accompony your current song (based on the genre).
